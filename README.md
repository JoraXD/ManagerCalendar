# Tour Guide Manager

This project provides a small FastAPI backend and React frontend for managing excursions and users.

## Development

1. Install dependencies for the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the application using the helper script:
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```

## Database


Example:

```
export FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=.venv/google-services.json
```

Firestore collections named `excursions` and `users` will be created automatically.
